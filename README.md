# ATENÇÃO: Projeto Descontinuado

O Rollify foi um sucesso, mas a comunidade necessita de algo a mais. Por isso, trago a vocês o Rollify Beyond.

Sucessor do Open RPG e Rollify, o Rollify Beyond combina o melhor dos meus projetos até agora.

O Open RPG e Rollify permanecerão disponíveis, porém não serão mais atualizados e, com o tempo, se tornarão obsoletos.

Espero vê-lo a bordo do Rollify Beyond!
